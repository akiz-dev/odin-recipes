        <li>
            <strong>Season the chicken:</strong><br>
            Season the chicken cubes with salt and black pepper to taste, then set aside.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Sauté onion, garlic, and ginger:</strong><br>
            In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat.
            Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3 minutes, until soft. 
            Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

        <li>
            <strong>Add the spices:</strong><br>
            Add the curry powder, cumin, and turmeric to the pan. Stir well and cook for about 1 minute, 
            allowing the spices to release their flavors, but be careful not to burn them.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the chicken:</strong><br>
            Add the chicken cubes to the pan and stir well to coat the chicken in the spices. 
            Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the chicken starts to brown.

            <strong>Add coconut milk and broth:</strong><br>
            Pour in the coconut milk and chicken (or vegetable) broth, stirring to combine. 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, 
            until the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Adjust the flavor:</strong><br>
            Stir in the soy sauce (if using) and lemon juice to balance the sweetness and acidity of the dish.

        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve and garnish:</strong><br>
            Serve the chicken curry over white rice or jasmine rice. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro, and if desired, 
            serve with naan bread or tortillas.
